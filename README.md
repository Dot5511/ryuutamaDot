# Ryuutama
Ryuutama System for Foundry VTT

# Ulterior Note
I, Dotkas, simply took on this project to try to make this run despite knowing next to nothing about coding. Please contact me at Dotkas on discord if you know any more. Anything but this note has been written by the original creator of this system.

# Some notes
I am still in the process of finalizing some of the compendiums. Most things do not have icons/art for them, and use the default icon.
Tutorials on how to use the system will come at a later time. They are in the process of being written and will be included in the wiki section when complete.
